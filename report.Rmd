# Maximum Likelihood estimation of $\theta$

The pdf is

\begin{equation}
  f(y_i; \theta) = \frac{\theta^2}{\theta + 1} (1 + y_i) \exp(-\theta y_i), i = 1 \dots n.
\end{equation}

The log likelihood is

\begin{align}
  \ell(\theta) &= 2n \log(\theta) - n \log(\theta + 1) - \theta \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i + c \\
               &\propto 2 \log(\theta) - \log(\theta + 1) - \theta \bar{y} + c.
\end{align}

The first derivative is

\begin{equation}
  \ell'(\theta) = \frac{2}{\theta} - \frac{1}{\theta + 1} - \bar{y},
\end{equation}

where $\bar{y}$ is the sample mean of $\bm{y}$.
Note, we can drop the n. \
Setting the derivative to zero leads to equation \@ref(eq:equation1) which has to be solved for $\theta$.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\theta + 2}{\theta (\theta + 1)} = \bar{y}.
  (\#eq:equation1)
\end{equation}

One approach is to use Newton-Raphson, which requires the second order derivative.

\begin{equation}
  \ell''(\theta) = -\frac{2}{\theta^2} + \frac{1}{(\theta + 1)^2},
\end{equation}

# Estimation of standard error

The pdf can be restated as

\begin{equation}
  f(y_i; \theta) = \frac{\theta}{\theta + 1} \theta \exp(-\theta y_i) + \frac{1}{\theta + 1} \theta^2 y_i \exp(-\theta y_i),
\end{equation}

i.e., a mixture of two gamma distributions in shape and rate parameterization.
$\theta$ is the rate and the shapes are equal to 1 and 2.

It is straight forward to simulate from this, but starting from $U \overset{iid}{\sim} U(0, 1)$ exponentially distributed variables can be obtained via inversion

\begin{equation}
  f^{-1}(u; \theta) = - \frac{\log(u)}{\theta},
\end{equation}

which is the same as a gamma with shape one and a gamma with shape 2 is obtained via the sum of 2 exponentials.
For optimizing computation time $n$ observations are generated in the following way:

1) Draw the number of shape 2 gammas (n2) by counting the number of $u < \frac{1}{\theta + 1}$
1) Sample $n$ and $n2$ uniforms
1) Transform the uniforms to exponentials using $f^{-1}$
1) Add to the fist $n2$ of the $n$ exponentials the other exponentials
1) Return

The result is a sample with $n2$ observations of a gamma distribution with shape 2 and $n - n2$ observation of a gamma distribution with shape 1.

For the purpose of estimating $\theta$ with the estimator of section \@ref(maximum-likelihood-estimation-of-theta) it is of no importance that the sample is sorted by shape.
