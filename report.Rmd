# Maximum Likelihood estimation of $\theta$

## Notation

In the following random variables (RV) are denoted with capital letters, e.g. $Y$, their realizations with lowercase letters, e.g., $y_i$, where always $i = 1, ..., n$.
Loglikelihoods are written, e.g., as $\ell(\theta)$.
For parameters, Greek letters are used and their estimators are distinguished with a hat, e.g., $\hat{\theta}$.
In the context of this project, derivatives are only taken when functions are viewed as functions of one variable, denoted, e.g., as $\ell'(\theta)$.

## Likelihood

Given are `r length(vec_sample)` one dimensional data.
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-y) shows a histogram of them.
They exhibit a positive skew.

```{r plot-y, fig.cap='(ref:plot-y)'}
p1
```
(ref:plot-y) Histogram of provided data. The black line indicates the sample mean.

It is assumed they are independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) realizations $y_i$ of a RV $Y$ with probability density function (PDF)

\begin{equation}
  f_\theta(y_i) = \frac{\theta^2}{\theta + 1} (1 + y_i) \exp(-\theta y_i),\quad y_i, \theta > 0.
\end{equation}

The goal is to estimate $\theta$ via maximum likelihood (ML).
Its loglikelihood

\begin{align}
  \ell(\theta) &= \log \left( \prod_{i = 1}^n f_\theta(y_i) \right) \notag \\
    &= 2n \log(\theta) - n \log(\theta + 1) - \theta \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i + c \notag \\
    &\propto 2 \log(\theta) - \log(\theta + 1) - \theta \bar{y} + c,
\end{align}

where $c$ is a constant, which does not depend on $\theta$, and thus is irrelevant for the following calculations.
The last term (1.2) results by dividing the loglikelihood by the number of observations $n$, so $\bar{y}$ denotes the sample mean. \
The first derivative of (1.2)

\begin{equation}
  \ell'(\theta) = \frac{2}{\theta} - \frac{1}{\theta + 1} - \bar{y}.
\end{equation}

There is no analytical solution available for equating (1.3) to zero and solving for $\theta$.

## Newton-Raphson

The maximum of $\ell(\theta)$ has to be found numerically, here via Newton-Raphson, i.e., iteratively applying

\begin{equation}
  \theta^* = \theta - \frac{\ell'(\theta)}{\ell''(\theta)},
\end{equation}

where $\ell''(\theta) = -\frac{2}{\theta^2} + \frac{1}{(\theta + 1)^2}$, $\theta$ is the value at iteration $t$ and $\theta^*$ is the updated value at iteration $t + 1$, until the update gets very close to zero.
The final value is taken as the ML estimate.

For the given data $\hat{\theta} =$ `r theta_hat`.

# Bootstrapping for standard error of $\hat{\theta}$

## Sampling from $f_{\hat{\theta}}(y_i)$

The goal is to quantify the uncertainty of $\hat{\theta}$.
For this parametric bootstrap is applied, for which sampling from $f_{\hat{\theta}}(y_i)$ is necessary.
The starting point is restating (1.1) as

\begin{equation}
  f_\theta(y_i) = \frac{\theta}{\theta + 1} \theta \exp(-\theta y_i) + \frac{1}{\theta + 1} \theta^2 y_i \exp(-\theta y_i)
\end{equation}

and recognizing this as a mixture of two gamma distributions in shape and rate parameterization, where $\theta$ is the rate and the shapes are equal to one and two, respectively.

Starting from first principals, it is assumed only RVs $U \overset{iid}{\sim} U(0, 1)$ are available.
This is not to much of a hassle, as Gamma RVs with shape $j$ are the sum of $j$ Exponential RVs, which in turn can be easily obtained via inversion

\begin{equation}
  f^{-1}(u; \theta) = - \frac{\log(u)}{\theta},
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ already is the desired rate.

This is implemented in the following steps:

1) Draw $n$ $u_i$.
1) Calculate $n$ temporary $y_i = f^{-1}(u_i; \hat{\theta})$ with shape one.
1) Draw the number of shape two gammas $n_2$.
   1) Draw another $n$ $u_j$.
   1) $n_2 = \#\{u_j | u_j < \frac{1}{\hat{\theta} + 1}\}$.
1) Draw $n_2$ $u_k$.
1) Calculate $n_2$ temporary $y_k = f^{-1}(u_k; \hat{\theta})$ with shape one.
1) Add $y_k$s component-wise to the fist $n_2$ $y_i$.
1) Return $y_i$s.

Returned is a sample of size $n$, which can be seen as a realization of $Y_i$ with PDF $f_\theta(y_i)$.
$n_2$ observations are realizations of Gamma RVs with shape two and $n - n2$ observation of are realizations of Gamma RVs with shape one.

For the purpose of estimating $\theta$ with the estimator of Section \@ref(newton-raphson) it is of no importance that the sample is sorted by shape.

## Bootstrap standard error

Given $B$ samples of size $n$ from the sampler of the previous section, and corresponding bootstrap estimates $\hat{\theta}_b^*,\ b = 1, ..., B$, the bootstrap standard error

\begin{equation}
  \hat{\text{se}}_B(\hat{\theta}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b = 1}^B (\hat{\theta}_b^* - \hat{\theta}^*)^2},
\end{equation}

according to the lecture slides, where $\hat{\theta}^*$ is the sample mean of all $\hat{\theta}_b^*$.

For this simulation $B = 10^4$ and the resulting $\hat{\text{se}}_B(\hat{\theta}) =$ `r theta_hat.se`.

# EM

## Augmented data

Consider a more complex PDF for the given data

\begin{equation}
  f_\pi(y_i) = \pi f_\theta(y_i) + (1 - \pi) f_\lambda(y_i),\quad y_i > 0, \pi \in [0, 1],
\end{equation}

where $f_\theta(y_i)$ is the PDF from before and $f_\lambda(y_i) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda y_i)$, i.e., $f_\pi(y_i)$ is a mixture of two PDFs. \
The goal is to estimate $\theta, \lambda$ and $\pi$ using an EM algorithm.

Start by introducing augmented data $x_i$ and assume they are realizations from $X_i \sim Ber(\pi)$.
An equivalent formulation of (3.1) thus is

\begin{equation}
  f(\theta, \lambda | x_i, y_i) = f_\theta(y_i)^{x_i} f_\lambda(y_i)^{1 - x_i},
\end{equation}

where the likelihood of $\theta$ and $\lambda$ is computed given $x_i, y_i$.
I.e., simulation from $f_\pi(y_i)$ given $\theta, \lambda$ and $\pi$ is possible, by first drawing $x_i$ and then drawing from $f_\theta(y_i)$ if $x_i = 1$ or $f_\lambda(y_i)$ if $x_i = 0$.
(3.2) is called complete likelihood, while (3.1) is called observed likelihood.

## Expectation

For the first part of the EM algorithm an expression for $\mathbb{E}(X_i | \pi, \theta, \lambda, y_i)$ is needed.
This is obtained by applying Bayes' theorem

\begin{align}
  f(x_i | \theta, \lambda, \pi, y_i)
  &= \dfrac{f(\theta, \lambda | x_i, y_i) f(x_i | \pi)}{f(\theta, \lambda | y_i)} \notag \\
  &= \dfrac{f_\theta(y_i)^{x_i} f_\lambda(y_i)^{1 - x_i}\ \pi^{x_i} (1 - \pi)^{1 - x_i}}{(1 - \pi) f_\lambda(y_i) + \pi f_\theta(y_i)}.
\end{align}

The second line is implied by the distribution of $X_i$ and by the fact that $f(\theta, \lambda | y_i) = f(x_i = 0 | \pi) f(\theta, \lambda | x_i = 0, y_i) + f(x_i = 1 | \pi) f(\theta, \lambda | x_i = 1, y_i)$. \
One can immediately see

\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{E}(X_i | \pi, \theta, \lambda, y_i) = \dfrac{f_\theta(y_i) \pi }{(1 - \pi) f_\lambda(y_i) + \pi f_\theta(y_i)}.
\end{equation}

## Maximization

The second step is simple maximum likelihood estimation given the augmented data.
The loglikelihoods of the respective parameters are

\begin{align}
  \ell(\pi)     &= \log(\pi) \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + \log(1 - \pi) \sum_{i = 1}^n (1 - x_i), \\
  \ell(\lambda) &= n \log(\lambda) - \lambda \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i - \log(\lambda) \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + \lambda \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i + c, \\
  \ell(\theta)  &= 2 \log(\theta) \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i - \log(\theta + 1) \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i - \theta \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i + c \notag \\
                &\propto 2 \log(\theta) - \log(\theta + 1)  - \theta \tilde{y} + c,
\end{align}

where $\tilde{y} = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i / \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$.

The maximizer of (3.5) is $\hat{\pi} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$. \
It is also possible to maximize (3.6) analytically, via $\hat{\lambda} = (n - \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i) / (\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i - \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i)$.
This can be interpreted as the inverse of the sample mean of the $y_i$, where $x_i = 0$. \
(3.7) has no close form and is maximized using Newton-Raphson (see Section \@ref(newton-raphson)), substituting $\bar{y}$ with $\tilde{y}$, which can be interpreted as the sample mean of the $y_i$, where $x_i = 1$.

## Application

* Starting from initial guesses, $\pi = 0.5, \theta = 1, \lambda = 1$, a first version of $x_i$s is generated using the result from Section \@ref(expectation).
* Next, the parameters are updated using the results from Section \@ref(maximization).
* Now iterate between the expectation and the maximization step while monitoring the observed likelihood of current parameter estimates.
* Stop when there no longer is a relative increase in the observed likelihood and return $\hat{\pi}, \hat{\theta}, \hat{\lambda}$, the maximum likelihood estimates.

For the given data $\hat{\pi} =$ `r em.run$p_hat`, $\hat{\theta} =$ `r em.run$theta_hat` and $\hat{\lambda} =$ `r em.run$lambda_hat`.

The augmented data can be seen as the probability of the observations pertaining to the cluster, where the PDF is $f_\theta(y_i)$.
As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-xy), the probability of datum $i$ to be from cluster $c_\theta$ increases linearly with $y$.
